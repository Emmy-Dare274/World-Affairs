## Acknowledgments

- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Thank you to the Amazing Slack community members and the support team.

- [Iuliias Konovalova](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova) The best mentor ever, even though she is expecting a baby girl soon, I wish her congratulations as she put to bed. She calmly supported me with different videos to wash to get the algorithm working properly and she also helped me so much in working out the wireframe, she is a walking tool, I wish to be a professional Software Engineer like her someday. She literally has answers to all problems, even when I was extremely stuck on Javascript as it wasn't working on the Live view, she came to my rescue, I almost gave up because I am working and the deadline is just to close for me to achieve it, but she made shure it is achievable for me whilst there is still a lot to work on.
